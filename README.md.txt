Version 1.0.0.0

This game was inspired by the classic Labyrinth game from which this one derives its name.
The concept is simple: four players via for their share of the loot in an ever-changing maze.

The current player is shown in the top-right corner. 
You click one of the red arrows enacasing the maze to cycle the maze in that direction. 
Next you'll use the WASD keys to manuever your piece through the newly made paths.

Once all the treasure has been collected a winner is announced.
