Starting...
Main Camera contains TurnControl.cs which lets you select a PlayerPiece as the starting player; on Start() that player gets its Movement method subscribed to its OnUpdate event.

Gameplay...
The Movement method is split into two portions: 1) getting player input, 2) applying velocity to its rigidbody.
(The rigidbody is 2D and kinematic).

Whenever a PlayerPiece collides with a TreasurePiece the TreasurePiece is disabled and hidden; TreasurePiece's static TotalCollectedTreasure increases by 1; EndgameScene's CheckGameComplete is passed and if you've collected all the pieces of treasure the game ends. 

Once all pieces of Treasure have been collected the EndGame method is ran. It's split into three portions: Revealing the canvas, starting the timer to reset the game, and disabling the turn system. This can only be passed once.
